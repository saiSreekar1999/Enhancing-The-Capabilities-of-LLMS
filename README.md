# Enhancing-The-Capabilities-of-LLMS

 **Repository Description:**  This repository hosts the project undertaken at AlphaTrAi, a forefront AI-based fintech company, where I led the initiative to advance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Utilizing the Langchain framework, our team developed a sophisticated system designed to analyze and summarize extensive SEC data effectively, while also extracting detailed entities and relationships. 

 **Key Features:** - **LLM Fine-Tuning:** Enhanced the LLM's accuracy for entity extraction by fine-tuning with 60,000 tokens, focusing on precise and reliable data interpretation.

- **Data Synthesis and Relationship Mapping:** Integrated a complex process to synthesize extracted data to identify and map relationships, which were then incorporated into a graph database. Each node within this database is enriched with essential metadata like file names and summaries.

 - **Synonym Level Mapping and Taxonomy Development:** Introduced Synonym Level Mapping and developed a specialized taxonomy to categorize solely legal entities, enhancing the filter precision and usability of the extracted data. 

 **Impact:** - The enhancements brought forth by this project significantly streamlined legal analysis procedures for our clients, reducing their operational workload by 20%. - Achieved substantial cost savings, amounting to $307,000, by improving efficiency and reducing the time required for data processing. 

 **Purpose of This Repository:** - To document the methodologies used in enhancing the LLM. - To share codes and frameworks that could assist other developers in similar or derivative projects. - To track changes and improvements made during the project lifecycle. 

 **Conclusion:** This project not only demonstrates the potential of using advanced AI models like LLMs in legal data analytics but also sets a benchmark for future enhancements in the field of legal tech at AlphaTrAi. The documented success herein provides a solid foundation for ongoing improvements and innovations.
