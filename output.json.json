        "Summary": "Summary:\nRule 15fh-4(c) prohibits any officer, director, supervised person, or employee of an SBS Entity from coercing, misleading, or interfering with the SBS Entity's CCO. This rule aims to support the CCO in fostering compliance within the SBS Entity, ultimately reducing the risk of fraudulent activities in the security-based swap market. It encourages better communication and information exchange between CCOs and other individuals within the SBS Entity, leading to improved compliance and decision-making. While the rule may incur additional costs for SBS Entities in updating policies and procedures, the benefits of deterring actions that hinder the CCO's independence and objectivity outweigh these costs. Overall, Rule 15fh-4(c) is expected to have positive impacts on competition, price efficiency, and capital formation within the security-based swap market.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the impact of Rule 9j-1 and Rule 15fh-4(c) on competition and efficiency in the security-based swap market. Rule 9j-1 aims to reduce the risk of fraud, which could lead to increased competition among market participants. This is because a more secure market environment may encourage greater participation in security-based swaps. On the other hand, Rule 15fh-4(c) supports the oversight of compliance with Federal securities laws by the CCO within the SBS Entity, reducing the risk of fraud and potentially increasing competition in the market.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, Rule 9j-1 is expected to enhance price efficiency by decreasing the risk of fraud and preventing price manipulation in the security-based swap market. This could result in security-based swap prices more accurately reflecting fundamental values and risks, leading to greater market efficiency. Similarly, Rule 15fh-4(c) may have a minor indirect positive impact on price efficiency by increasing participation in the market, allowing for more information to be incorporated into security-based swap prices through increased trading activity.\n\nOverall, both rules have the potential to positively impact competition and efficiency in the security-based swap market by reducing fraud risk, supporting compliance oversight, and enhancing price accuracy. These measures aim to create a more transparent and competitive market environment for market participants.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the impact of opportunistic strategies on the Credit Default Swap (CDS) market, highlighting how these strategies can decouple CDS prices from credit fundamentals and reduce the market's efficiency and liquidity. It also mentions the potential consequences of manufactured credit events on lenders and the overall value of CDS as a risk-transferring instrument.\n\nIn terms of the existing regulatory frameworks, the document outlines the regulatory provisions governing security-based swaps under the Exchange Act, including antifraud and anti-manipulation rules. It also mentions the Dodd-Frank Act's expansion of anti-manipulation provisions to cover security-based swap transactions and the Commission's adoption of rules to prevent fraud and manipulation in connection with these swaps.\n\nFurthermore, the document provides information on the number of entities registered as Security-Based Swap Dealers (SBSDs) and Major Security-Based Swap Participants (MSBSPs) with the Commission, as well as the reporting requirements for security-based swap transactions to registered data repositories. It also includes data on the levels of security-based swap trading activity across different asset classes, such as credit, equity, and interest rate swaps, as reported to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation Data Repository and the ICE Trade Vault.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of regulatory frameworks, reporting requirements, and market activity data in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the security-based swap market.",

        "Summary": "The document discusses the consideration of alternatives by the Commission when finalizing Rules 9j-1 and 15fh-4(c). Commenters recommended narrowing the scope of Rule 9j-1 by excluding valuation, payment, and delivery, certain credit market conduct, and security-based swaps referencing sovereign debt. The Commission decided against these alternatives as they could create gaps in the prohibition against manipulation and attempted manipulation of security-based swap prices. The exclusion of certain credit market conduct could unintentionally apply to prohibited activities, and excluding sovereign debt security-based swaps could increase fraudulent and manipulative conduct. Safe harbors were also suggested, such as one for hedging exposure arising from lending activities, but the Commission noted the difficulty in identifying legitimate hedging activity and the potential unintended consequences of such safe harbors. Ultimately, the Commission determined that the adopted approach is preferable to the alternatives considered.",

        "Summary": "The document discusses the rules and regulations regarding prohibited activities in the equity, debt, or loan markets, specifically in relation to security-based swaps. The Commission analyzes transactions in these markets to determine if they violate certain provisions of securities laws. The document also proposes two limited safe harbors to address operational concerns raised by commenters, allowing for certain actions to be taken in accordance with binding contractual rights and obligations under a security-based swap. Additionally, a safe harbor is provided for transactions related to portfolio compression exercises. The Commission has included these safe harbors in response to feedback and operational considerations.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses proposed Rule 9j-1, which addresses the use of material nonpublic information in security-based swap transactions. The rule includes two affirmative defenses to liability under Rule 9j-1(a)(1) through (a)(5). The first defense pertains to actions taken in accordance with binding contractual rights under the documentation governing a security-based swap. The second defense applies to actions taken by a person, other than a natural person, who demonstrates that the individual making the investment decision was not aware of material nonpublic information and that reasonable policies and procedures were implemented to prevent violations of Rule 9j-1(a)(1) through (a)(5). The Commission declined to adopt additional safe harbors, as the affirmative defenses provide consistency with Rule 10b5-1 and address concerns raised by market participants. The pdf also discusses Rule 15fh-4(c), which aims to protect the independence and objectivity of an SBS Entity's Chief Compliance Officer by preventing personnel from coercing, misleading, or interfering with the CCO. The Commission adopted Rule 15fh-4(c) as proposed to safeguard the CCO's independence and ensure compliance with federal securities laws.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the potential risks of fraud and market manipulation in the security-based swap market and the importance of communication within SBS Entities to facilitate decision-making. Rule 15fh-4(c) aims to deter actions that hinder Chief Compliance Officers (CCOs) from performing their duties, thus protecting their independence and objectivity. While the rule may create additional costs for SBS Entities by requiring updates to policies and procedures, the Commission believes the impact will not be significant due to the specificity of the rule.\n\nOne concern raised is the potential confusion and uncertainty regarding the scope of the rule, which could impede communication and decision-making within SBS Entities. The Commission has clarified the scope of Rule 15fh-4(c) to address this issue. The rule prohibits coercive, manipulative, misleading, or fraudulent actions towards the CCO, aiming to improve communication and decision-making within SBS Entities.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the final rules are expected to have various effects. By reducing the risk of fraud, Rule 9j-1 could encourage market participation and increase competition in the security-based swap market. Rule 15fh-4(c) is likely to have a minor positive impact on competition by supporting CCO oversight and reducing fraud risk. Additionally, both rules may contribute to increased price efficiency in the security-based swap market by preventing manipulation and incorporating more information into prices through increased trading activity.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the potential impacts of Rule 9j-1 and Rule 15fh-4(c) on competition, efficiency, and capital formation in the security-based swap market. Rule 9j-1 is expected to increase competition by reducing the risk of fraud, leading to greater participation in the market. This could result in security-based swaps reflecting the fundamental credit risk of the underlying entity, encouraging more market participants to engage in trading. Similarly, Rule 15fh-4(c) is likely to have a positive impact on competition by supporting compliance with securities laws and reducing fraud risk, thereby increasing market participation and competition among participants.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, Rule 9j-1 is anticipated to enhance price efficiency by preventing fraud and price manipulation in the market. This would lead to security-based swap prices more accurately reflecting fundamental values and risks, increasing market efficiency. Rule 15fh-4(c) may also contribute to price efficiency indirectly by increasing market participation and incorporating more information into security-based swap prices.\n\nRegarding capital formation, Rule 9j-1 is expected to have a positive impact by promoting greater activity in the underlying security market, lowering capital costs, and increasing capital formation for underlying entities. The rule could encourage lenders to use security-based swaps for hedging, potentially boosting lending activity and capital formation. Despite concerns about compliance costs and liability standards, the rule's clear guidelines and beneficial effects on capital formation are believed to outweigh any potential adverse effects.\n\nOverall, both Rule 9j-1 and Rule 15fh-4(c) are likely to have positive effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation in the security-based swap market, ultimately benefiting market participants and underlying entities.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses various suggestions and alternatives related to Rule 9j-1, which pertains to security-based swap transactions. Commenters proposed adding safe harbors to the rule, such as for hedging exposure arising from lending activities and for lender disclosure, centralized market activities, and legitimate restructurings. However, the adopted approach, which includes affirmative defenses in Rule 9j-1(e), is deemed preferable as it addresses concerns about fraud and manipulation in the security-based swap market. The document also mentions a suggestion for a safe harbor for publicly executed strategies, but the Commission declines to adopt this alternative due to concerns about manipulative activity. Additionally, some commenters advocated for the elimination of all safe harbors and affirmative defenses, but the adopted approach, which provides two affirmative defenses in final Rule 9j-1(e), is considered more favorable. Overall, the document highlights the importance of balancing regulatory measures with market participants' needs and the potential impact on market dynamics.",

        "Summary": "Summary:\nThe pdf file provides detailed information on security-based swap data, market participants, dealing structures, and levels of security-based swap trading activity as of January 4, 2023. There were 50 entities registered as SBSDs with the Commission, while no entities were registered as MSBSPs. Market participants such as SBSDs and MSBSPs were required to report security-based swap transactions to registered security-based swap data repositories. The Commission uses information reported to two registered SBSDRs, Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation Data Repository (DDR) and ICE Trade Vault (ITV), to describe the baseline of U.S. security-based swap market activity split across credit, equity, and interest rate asset classes. The data shows the number of active security-based swaps and gross notional amounts outstanding in each asset class. The pdf also discusses the relationships between SBS Entities and non-SBS Entities in the U.S. security-based swap market, detailing the number of active swaps and gross notional amounts outstanding for each entity type. Additionally, the document analyzes the benefits and costs of Rule 9j-1, focusing on how the rule may decrease fraudulent activity, litigation costs, and compliance costs while potentially increasing price efficiency and decreasing capital costs for underlying entities. The pdf also includes comments received on the proposed rule, addressing concerns about compliance costs and uncertainty among market participants. Overall, the document provides a comprehensive overview of the entities, relationships, and interactions within the security-based swap market regulatory framework.",

        "Summary": "The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 3a1-1 under the SEA to exempt security-based swap execution facilities (SBSEFs) from the definition of \"exchange\" if they solely provide a marketplace for trading security-based swaps (SBS) and have registered as an SBSEF. This exemption aims to prevent SBSEFs from being burdened with additional regulatory requirements as national securities exchanges. The proposed amendments also include exemptions for clearing agencies that operate trading sessions to support end-of-day valuations of SBS. The Commission received comments on the proposed amendments, with one commenter expressing concerns about potential loopholes and another suggesting broader exemptions for entities trading solely in SBS. The Commission clarified the scope of the exemptions and made modifications to align with the regulatory framework established by the Dodd Frank Act. Additionally, the Commission addressed the classification of SBSEFs as brokers under Rule 15a-12, highlighting the need for exceptions or exemptions to avoid duplicative registration requirements. Overall, the Commission adopted the amendments to Rule 3a1-1 with modifications to ensure consistency with the regulatory framework for SBSEFs and to address concerns raised by commenters.",

        "Summary": "The document discusses the introductory provisions of Regulation SE, which apply to Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs) and Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities (SBSEFs) registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and the Securities Exchange Act (SEA) respectively. Rule 800 outlines the scope of Regulation SE, stating that it applies to all SEFs and SBSEFs registered or applying for registration. Rule 801 specifies that SEFs and SBSEFs must comply with the requirements of Regulation SE and other relevant CFTC regulations. The Commission received no comments on these rules and is adopting them as proposed with minor technical modifications. This summary highlights the relationship between regulatory bodies like the CFTC, legislative bodies like the CEA and SEA, and market participants such as SEFs and SBSEFs within the regulatory framework.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the registration requirements for entities operating as security-based swap execution facilities (SBSEFs) under Rule 803 of Regulation SE. The proposed rule closely mirrors the CFTC's rules and outlines the process for registration with the Commission as an SBSEF. It specifies that any person operating a facility offering a trading system where multiple market participants can execute or trade security-based swaps must register as an SBSEF. The rule also mandates that an SBSEF must offer an order book and provides exceptions for certain transactions.\n\nThe document further details the procedures for full registration of an SBSEF, including filing requirements, confidentiality considerations, and amendments to the registration application. It also addresses the review period for registration applications and the criteria for granting or denying registration. Additionally, the rule covers reinstatement of dormant registrations, transfer of registration, withdrawal of applications, and vacation requests.\n\nComments and analysis from stakeholders are included, with some supporting streamlined registration processes for entities already registered with the CFTC as SEFs. They argue that this approach would reduce registration burdens and expedite the establishment of the SBSEF regime. However, there are differing opinions on whether exemptive authority should be used for SEFs seeking SBSEF registration, with concerns raised about impartiality and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nOverall, the document emphasizes the importance of harmonizing SBSEF regulations with existing CFTC rules to minimize costs for dual-registrants and facilitate efficient trading of security-based swaps. The Commission ultimately adopts Rule 803 as proposed, with minor technical modifications, and outlines the requirements for using Form SBSEF for registration and submission of supplemental information.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the proposed rules for listing products for trading by certification under the CFTC's rules and the Commission's rules. The proposed Rule 804 outlines the procedures for an SBSEF to list a product via certification, including filing requirements, submission deadlines, and the content of the self-certification. The rule also allows the Commission to stay the certification of a new product for further review under certain circumstances. \n\nOne commenter raised concerns about the self-certification process, stating that it may pose risks to investors and market stability. However, the Commission disagrees, arguing that the process allows for sufficient review and public comment to protect investors and maintain fair markets. The Commission also emphasizes the importance of harmonization with CFTC filing procedures and the need for a longer review period to ensure compliance with the SEA and Regulation SE.\n\nAnother proposed rule, Rule 805, outlines procedures for SBSEFs to voluntarily submit new SBS products for Commission review and approval. The submission requirements include filing electronically, providing a copy of the product's rules, and explaining its compliance with relevant regulations. The Commission aims to strike a balance between allowing SBSEFs to list new products quickly and ensuring thorough review to protect market participants.\n\nOverall, the proposed rules aim to establish a framework for listing products for trading by certification, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and protecting investors and market stability. The Commission emphasizes the importance of thorough review and public comment in the self-certification process to address potential risks and maintain fair and efficient markets.",

The document further introduces Rule 812, which ensures that transactions on an SBSEF cannot be invalidated due to violations of the SEA or Commission rules. The Commission received no comments on these proposed rules and is adopting them as outlined in the Proposing Release. The rules aim to enhance oversight and regulatory compliance within the SBSEF framework, promoting transparency and accountability in the financial market infrastructure.",

The guidance provided in the appendix is illustrative and not mandatory. The document also addresses how the Commission has incorporated CFTC guidance into Regulation SE. \n\nRule 818 pertains to Core Principle 1, which requires an SBSEF to be registered, maintain registration, and comply with core principles and any additional requirements imposed by the Commission. SBSEFs have discretion in how they comply with core principles. The Commission received no comments on Rule 818 and is adopting it as proposed.\n\nRule 819 relates to Core Principle 2, which mandates SBSEFs to establish and enforce compliance with their own rules, including terms and conditions of SBS trading. The document does not mention any comments received on Rule 819.\n\nOverall, the document highlights the importance of compliance with core principles and rules for SBSEFs, emphasizing the regulatory framework and oversight by the Commission in ensuring adherence to these standards.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses Rule 832, which addresses the application of the trade execution requirement to cross-border security-based swap (SBS) transactions. The rule defines a \"covered person\" as a U.S. person, a non-U.S. person guaranteed by a U.S. person, or a non-U.S. person using U.S. personnel to arrange SBS transactions. The rule aims to prevent evasion of SBS regulations by ensuring that the trade execution requirement applies to transactions with significant connections to the U.S.\n\nSeveral commenters support Rule 832, stating that it helps prevent evasion of the trade execution requirement. However, some commenters oppose aspects of the rule, arguing that it imposes unnecessary regulatory burdens on foreign entities and could lead to market fragmentation. They suggest that foreign jurisdictions already have robust regulatory regimes in place.\n\nThe Commission defends Rule 832, stating that it aligns with its statutory authority and is essential for mitigating risks in the SBS market. The rule aims to ensure transparency, impartial access, and risk mitigation in SBS transactions. The Commission also addresses concerns about the impact of the rule on CFTC-registered SEFs and the potential complexities of applying it to ANE transactions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Commission adopts Rule 832 as proposed, with minor technical modifications. The rule is intended to address the trade execution requirement for cross-border SBS transactions and ensure regulatory compliance and risk mitigation in the SBS market.",

        "Summary": "The provided pdf file content discusses Proposed Rule 834, which aims to define terms and impose a cap on voting rights for members of SBSEFs or SBS exchanges. The Commission received no comments on the definition of terms in Rule 834(a) and is adopting it as proposed. However, there is a comment opposing Rule 834(b) as it may disrupt harmonization with CFTC rules, which do not have similar provisions for SEF registrants. The commenter suggests focusing on governance, conflicts of interest, and antitrust considerations rather than strict rules. The Commission's concerns about conflicts of interest could be addressed by ensuring compliance with SBSEF Core Principles. This highlights the importance of considering regulatory relationships and interactions between different regulatory bodies and entities within the financial market infrastructure.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses the requirements and exemptions related to the registration of entities as clearing agencies and Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities (SBSEFs) under Regulation SE. It outlines the timeline for the termination of exemptive relief for entities transitioning from the 2011 Clearing Agency Exemption to registration as clearing agencies. The document also addresses the use of electronic filing systems and structured data languages, specifically Inline XBRL, for various filings and submissions by SBSEFs. \n\nThe Commission received comments on the proposed electronic filing requirements, with some suggesting alternative filing systems like the Electronic Form Filing System (EFFS) over EDGAR. However, the Commission ultimately decided to adopt Inline XBRL and EDGAR for certain disclosures to enhance accessibility and data validation. The document also highlights the specific exhibits and attachments required for Form SBSEF filings, including copies of agreements, organizational documents, and compliance manuals.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission explains the rationale behind the structured data language requirements, emphasizing the benefits of machine-readable data for regulators, market participants, and the public. While some disclosures will be filed in Inline XBRL, others will be in custom XML to streamline data processing and reduce compliance burdens on SBSEFs. The document also addresses the implementation of these requirements, including changes to rule texts and the submission cover sheet instructions for SBSEF filings.\n\nOverall, the pdf file content provides detailed information on the regulatory framework, electronic filing requirements, and structured data language mandates for SBSEFs under Regulation SE. It underscores the importance of data accessibility, validation, and compliance in the financial market infrastructure to ensure transparency and regulatory oversight.",

        "Summary": "The Commission is adopting Rule 803 with minor technical modifications. Form SBSEF is required for entities to register as an SBSEF, providing information on business organization, financial resources, compliance program, affiliates, and operational capability. The Commission will review Form SBSEF and grant registration, deny the application, or grant registration subject to conditions. The rules for SBSEF registration are closely harmonized with the CFTC's rules, with some exceptions. The CFTC's process for registering SEFs serves as a basis for registering SBSEFs. SBSEFs are expected to be dually registered as SEFs. While Form SBSEF closely matches Form SEF, exhibits to Form SBSEF will be structured, machine-readable documents. SBSEFs cannot provide copies of Form SEF exhibits in lieu of Form SBSEF exhibits. Rule and product filings by SBSEFs are necessary for changes to rules and product offerings, with a review process to ensure consistency with regulations. Close harmonization with the CFTC's filing procedures allows for efficient oversight of dual registrants. Parts 37 and 40 of the CFTC's rules provide processes for SEFs to establish or amend rules and list products.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the burden on operating registered clearing agencies to comply with Rule 17Ad-25(j, including one-time and annual costs. It also mentions the need for flexibility in governance, operations, and risk management for registered clearing agencies to consider their unique characteristics and circumstances. The Commission recognizes the importance of balancing governance flexibility with improving corporate governance and stability in the financial markets. Some commenters suggested more prescriptive governance requirements, such as having a majority of independent directors on registered clearing agency boards. The Commission believes that the final rules strike a balance between imposing prescriptive governance requirements and enhancing the resilience of clearing markets and the U.S. financial system.",

        "Summary": "The economic baseline discussed in the document provides an overview of the current state of affairs in the market, including the number of registered clearing agencies, the distribution of participants across these agencies, and the scope of trading activity they process. There are currently six active registered clearing agencies in the United States, each offering different services such as central securities depository and central clearing counterparty services. These agencies operate under two organizational models and face limited competition in their markets due to high barriers to entry and economies of scale.\n\nThe document highlights the importance of registered clearing agencies in the U.S. securities markets, with central clearing benefiting participants by reducing counterparty risk and enabling more efficient margin netting. However, central clearing also concentrates risk within the clearing agencies, posing potential contagion risks to the broader financial system in case of operational disruptions or failures. Proper risk management is crucial to ensure the stability of the securities markets and the financial system.\n\nThe existing regulatory framework for clearing agencies registered with the Commission includes Exchange Act section 17A and the Dodd-Frank Act, along with related rules adopted by the Commission. Clearing agencies may also be subject to regulation by other domestic or foreign regulators, such as the CFTC. The Commission's examination of the effects of final rules on competition, efficiency, and capital formation takes into account the concentration of clearing and settlement services within a few entities, emphasizing the need for a balanced regulatory approach to ensure market stability and resilience.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the economic considerations and implications of final rules regarding board composition and nominating committees for registered clearing agencies. The final rules require a majority of the board to be independent directors, with specific requirements for board committees. The aim is to promote effective governance, mitigate divergent interests, and improve risk management practices. The rules also address concerns about lopsided representation and potential conflicts of interest among board members.\n\nThe Commission anticipates that the final independence rules will help mitigate divergent incentives when complemented with existing governance rules and enforcement of securities regulations. Standardizing the definition of independent director is expected to improve efficiency by reducing economic frictions and search costs related to monitoring by stakeholders.\n\nThere are three primary costs associated with the final rules: the need for registered clearing agencies to expend resources on documenting directors' independence, potentially adding independent directors to the board, and the potential reduction in relevant expertise on boards due to the requirement for independent directors. However, the rules allow eligible participant employees to serve as independent directors, mitigating some of these concerns.\n\nOverall, the final rules aim to enhance governance, promote fairness in board representation, and improve risk management practices within registered clearing agencies. The Commission acknowledges potential costs but believes that the benefits of increased independence and effectiveness in governance outweigh these concerns.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses the comments and responses regarding proposed Rules 17Ad-25(g) and (h) related to conflicts of interest in registered clearing agencies. Commenters generally supported the principles-based approach of the rules, but some urged the Commission to consider modifications. One commenter suggested that the rule should specify that agency policies require recusal until conflicts are fully eliminated. However, the Commission maintained that the current language of \"mitigate or eliminate\" conflicts provides flexibility for clearing agencies to address conflicts through reasonable policies and procedures.\n\nAnother commenter raised concerns about the impact on non-SIFIs and small and middle-market participants in the decision-making process. The Commission noted that Rule 17Ad-25(j) allows for the consideration of viewpoints from a range of participants to address concerns about stakeholder inclusion in decision-making.\n\nRegarding the use of \"reasonably designed\" policies and procedures, some commenters supported the approach, while one commenter felt that the language was too lenient towards clearing agencies. The Commission emphasized the importance of evaluating relationships objectively and stated that the current rules already require thoughtful policies tailored to each clearing agency's governance structure.\n\nOverall, the pdf file content highlights the importance of addressing conflicts of interest in registered clearing agencies through flexible and principles-based rules, considering the impact on various types of participants, and ensuring that policies and procedures are appropriately designed to promote transparency and integrity in decision-making processes.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses proposed rules related to the composition of boards of registered clearing agencies, specifically focusing on the requirements for independent directors. The proposed rules aim to ensure that a majority of directors are independent, with specific criteria outlined to determine independence. The rules also address the composition of committees and circumstances that would disqualify a director from being considered independent.\n\nThe Commission emphasizes the importance of independent directors in enhancing a board's effectiveness by reducing potential conflicts of interest and increasing confidence in the agency's governance. The structure and risk management tools of a clearing agency impact how stakeholders' interests align, with independent directors playing a crucial role in balancing these interests.\n\nComments received on the proposed rules varied, with concerns raised about conflicts of interest, retail investor representation, and failures to deliver transactions. The Commission clarifies that the proposed rules do not alter the status of clearing agencies as self-regulatory organizations (SROs) but aim to promote transparency, fair representation, and effective decision-making at the board level to enhance governance and public confidence in the agency's risk management function.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses proposed rules for registered clearing agencies, specifically focusing on conflicts of interest and the management of risks related to relationships with service providers for critical services. The proposed rules aim to promote governance integrity by identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest involving directors and senior managers. The rules require registered clearing agencies to establish policies and procedures to address conflicts of interest and ensure transparency in decision-making processes. Commenters generally support the principles-based approach of the rules, but some suggest modifications to strengthen the requirements. The Commission emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing conflicts of interest to maintain the integrity of governance decisions within clearing agencies. Additionally, the rules address the management of risks associated with relationships with service providers for critical services, requiring boards to review and approve policies and procedures governing these relationships. Overall, the proposed rules aim to enhance governance practices and risk management within registered clearing agencies.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses proposed Rule 17Ad-25, which requires registered clearing agencies to establish a nominating committee composed of independent directors to evaluate individual nominees for director positions. The nominating committee must document fitness standards approved by the board, ensuring nominees are not subject to any statutory disqualifications. The committee must consider nominees' expertise, availability, integrity, and how they complement existing board members. Stakeholder views, including those of transfer agents, settlement banks, and technology providers, must also be taken into account. The nominating committee has discretion in considering stakeholder views, which may include institutional and retail investors and other market infrastructures. Commenters generally supported the proposed rules but sought clarity on the nominating committee's role as the exclusive venue for considering nominees. The Commission addressed modifications to the rule to provide more clarity on this issue and other concerns raised by commenters.",

        "Summary": "The proposed Rule 17Ad-25(d) requires each registered clearing agency to establish a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to assist the board in overseeing risk management. The RMC must include representatives from the owners and participants of the clearing agency and provide independent and informed opinions to support safety and efficiency. The Commission proposed this rule to enhance risk management governance across all registered clearing agencies. Commenters generally supported the proposed approach, with some requesting clarifications or modifications. The Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-25(d) with certain modifications, including specifying that the RMC is \"of the board\" and its membership must be re-evaluated annually.\n\nMany commenters understood the proposed rule to require a board-level RMC, which was the Commission's intention. Some commenters requested clarification that the RMC is not merely an advisory body but has a critical focus on risk management. Others objected to the requirement for the RMC to be a board-level committee, suggesting that registered clearing agencies should have the discretion to structure their RMCs as they see fit. Overall, the establishment of RMCs as part of governance arrangements for registered clearing agencies aims to improve risk management and ensure the safety and efficiency of the financial market infrastructure.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses Proposed Rule 17Ad-25(i) which aims to manage risks from relationships with service providers for core services. It defines a \"service provider for critical services\" as any person contractually obligated to a registered clearing agency for supporting clearance and settlement functionality. The rule requires each agency to establish policies and procedures for managing risks related to these relationships, including board oversight and approval of service provider policies. The Commission proposed these requirements to address operational risks and ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory obligations.\n\nCommenters generally supported the proposed rule but raised concerns about the definition of \"service provider for critical services\" and the roles of senior management and the board. In response, the Commission modified the definition to clarify the scope of service providers and the responsibilities of senior management and the board. The modifications aim to address concerns about potential duplication of responsibilities and ensure effective oversight of service provider relationships.\n\nOverall, the pdf file content emphasizes the importance of managing risks from relationships with service providers for core services to maintain operational resilience and compliance with regulatory obligations. The Commission's proposed rule and subsequent modifications aim to enhance governance and oversight of service provider relationships within the registered clearing agency regulatory framework.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses the response to service provider relationships and risks within the regulatory framework. Rule 17Ad-25(i)(4) outlines the parameters for registered clearing agencies to establish policies and procedures for ongoing monitoring of service provider relationships and board evaluations of senior management actions. The board may delegate responsibilities to a qualified sub-committee under Rule 17Ad-25(e). Proposed Rule 17Ad-25(j) requires registered clearing agencies to consider stakeholder viewpoints on governance and operations. Stakeholders include investors, customers, and securities issuers. The rule aims to document the consideration of viewpoints to ensure transparency. Some commenters supported the approach, while others sought clarity on compliance and recommended limitations on the scope of the rule. Concerns were raised about duplicative requirements, with some suggesting that existing rules already consider stakeholder views. The Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-25(j) to supplement existing requirements and formalize processes at registered clearing agencies. Overall, the document emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement and transparency in governance within the regulatory framework.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses regulatory requirements under Rule 605 and Rule 606, which pertain to disclosure requirements for reporting entities and broker-dealers, respectively. Rule 605 requires reporting entities to provide standardized information on execution quality for covered orders in NMS stocks, while Rule 606 mandates broker-dealers to disclose the venues to which they route customer orders for execution. The document also addresses the establishment of a new infrastructure for consolidated market data, including the unimplemented Market Data Infrastructure (MDI) Rules, which aim to update and expand the content of consolidated market data.\n\nThe regulatory structure for consolidated market data prior to the MDI Rules implementation is outlined, along with the potential effects of the MDI Rules on market practices once implemented. The MDI Rules introduce changes such as a new round lot definition, expanded data content, and a decentralized consolidation model. These changes may impact order routing practices, execution quality metrics, and competitive standing among trading venues.\n\nAdditionally, the document discusses interactions between the Rule 605 amendments and other recent Commission proposals, such as the Settlement Cycle Adopting Release and other market structure proposals. Commenters have raised concerns about overlapping compliance costs and recommended an incremental approach to the Commission's market structure proposals.\n\nOverall, the pdf file content provides a detailed analysis of regulatory requirements, disclosure obligations, and potential impacts on market participants and practices within the financial regulatory framework.",

        "Summary": "The Commission received comments on the proposed summary report, with suggestions for new statistics and modifications to existing ones. After review, the Commission adopted the statistics in Rule 605(a)(2) with certain modifications and added new execution quality statistics. The summary report will not be equally weighted by symbol based on share volume, but will include execution quality statistics divided by notional order size buckets. The report will provide relevant information for evaluating pricing, execution speed, and order flow. The Commission also made conforming changes to ensure that the Rule 605(a)(1) detailed report contains all necessary information to reconstruct the summary report.\n\nSome commenters recommended differentiating between retail investors and professional customers in the summary report, but the Commission decided against it. The report will not be limited to orders with a notional value of less than $200,000, but will include execution quality information divided by notional order size buckets. The summary report will include metrics such as percentage of shares executed at the quote or better, average order size, average percentage price improvement, average effective spread, and average execution speed in milliseconds.\n\nThe Commission is adding new metrics to the summary report, including average notional order size, average midpoint, average percentage quoted spread, and average percentage realized spread at 15 seconds and 1 minute after execution. The report will be categorized by notional order size ranges and will provide an overview of a market center's or broker-dealer's execution quality in a user-friendly format. The Commission will require the use of spread-based weighting for certain statistics to ensure consistency and comparability among reporting entities.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the proposal to require centralized posting of Rule 605 reports, with the Commission considering options for creating a centralized electronic system to make these reports available to market participants. While some commenters supported centralization, concerns were raised about using the EDGAR system for this purpose. The Commission decided not to adopt centralized posting due to lack of consensus on implementation and concerns about costs and delays. The changes to Rule 605 aim to expand the scope of reports and improve execution quality statistics. An alternative proposal involves using CAT data to provide execution quality information, potentially eliminating the need for market centers and broker-dealers to prepare Rule 605 reports. Some commenters supported this approach, citing benefits such as increased transparency and reduced compliance burdens. The Commission acknowledges the value of standardized data but will continue to monitor this alternative in the context of CAT implementation. Existing Commission exemptive relief and staff statements related to Rule 600 and Rule 605 will be withdrawn upon the compliance date of the amendments.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the amendments made to Rule 605 reports by the Commission, focusing on categorization by order type and timestamp conventions. The Commission proposed changes to order type categories, including the addition of marketable immediate-or-cancel orders and midpoint-or-better limit orders. The amendments aim to provide more meaningful measures of execution quality for different types of orders. Additionally, the Commission proposed updating timestamp conventions to measure time in increments of a millisecond or finer.\n\nVarious stakeholders, including national securities exchanges, broker-dealers, and industry groups, provided comments on the proposed changes. The Commission received support for the overall changes to order type categories, with some suggestions for modifications. For example, there were discussions on the inclusion of beyond-the-midpoint limit orders and executable NMLOs in separate categories. Stakeholders also raised concerns about the impact of the amendments on execution quality statistics and the reporting of different order types.\n\nAfter considering the comments, the Commission decided to adopt the amendments with some adjustments. The final rule includes separate order type categories for marketable IOCs, executable NMLO IOCs, and midpoint-or-better IOCs. The Commission also expanded the scope of midpoint-or-better limit orders to include orders priced at the midpoint. Additionally, the Commission clarified that certain order types, such as market orders with an immediate or cancel instruction, do not require separate categories as their execution profiles are similar to other marketable IOCs.\n\nOverall, the amendments to Rule 605 aim to enhance the transparency and comparability of execution quality metrics for different types of orders. The Commission's decision to update timestamp conventions reflects the importance of measuring time accurately in the context of order execution. Stakeholders' feedback played a crucial role in shaping the final rule, ensuring that it meets the needs of market participants and promotes fair and efficient trading practices.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the amendments to Rule 605, focusing on compliance costs related to expanding the scope of reporting entities, modifications to information required, and the preparation of summary execution quality reports. The estimated compliance costs include initial and ongoing costs for various types of reporting entities, such as market centers, broker-dealers, and SDPs. The Commission acknowledges potential impacts on competition if compliance costs prevent new entities from entering the market or cause existing entities to leave. Additionally, the document addresses the implications of overlapping compliance periods with other regulatory requirements. Overall, the analysis considers the relationships and interactions between different entities within the regulatory framework to assess the impact of the Rule 605 amendments.",

There was support for separate reporting for NMS Stock ATSs and SDPs from market participants. The Commission is still considering changes to the definition of \"exchange\" and the impact on OEMs. SDPs will have separate reporting requirements, with concerns raised about potential impacts on Rule 605 metrics. The Commission believes separate reporting for SDPs is necessary to provide transparency and ensure accurate reporting of execution quality. The definition of SDPs has been clarified to focus on OTC market makers providing a trading system for a single dealer. The Commission addresses concerns about distinguishing between OTC market making and SDP activities in Rule 605 reports. Modifications to the scope of orders covered and required information have been made, with changes to order size and type groupings and execution quality metrics. Overall, the Commission has adopted the proposed changes to Rule 605 with certain modifications to enhance transparency and reporting accuracy in the OTC equity market.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses reasonable alternative modifications to the scope of covered orders, specifically focusing on ISO orders with limit prices inferior to the NBBO. The Commission considered explicitly including these orders within the scope of covered orders, either aggregated with other order types or as a separate category. ISOs account for a significant percentage of on-exchange trade volume, with ISO orders with limit prices inferior to the NBBO making up a small but non-negligible percent of order flow.\n\nAdditionally, the file suggests excluding orders that are quickly cancelled after submission, as these orders may be driven by trading strategies not intended to provide liquidity. Excluding quickly cancelled orders from the definition of \"covered order\" may lead to more informative fill rates and a more meaningful ranking of Rule 605 reporting entities.\n\nFurthermore, the file discusses including NMLOs submitted outside of regular trading hours as a separate order category in Rule 605 reports. While pre-open orders may have different characteristics, their inclusion along with other order types is unlikely to significantly skew execution quality statistics.\n\nIn terms of required information, the file explores defining order sizes based on the number of round lots rather than notional categories. While categories based on round lots may make it easier to compare execution quality metrics across market centers, they may not meet the objective of grouping orders with similar notional values. Categories based on notional values provide a more granular categorization of order sizes and incorporate real-time information about changing stock prices.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the requirement for market centers and broker-dealers to produce a summary report in a user-friendly PDF format and CSV format instead of XML. This change aims to make the data more accessible to a wider audience and facilitate comparisons. The Commission believes that providing the summary report in multiple formats will benefit investors and the public by allowing them to easily access and analyze the data without technical expertise. The use of CSV format, which is structured and machine-readable, will enable users to process and analyze the data more efficiently. Additionally, the Commission plans to provide investor education to ensure that the summary report is useful and understandable for retail investors. This includes providing resources to help investors interpret the data and make informed decisions when comparing broker-dealers' execution quality. The Commission also considers testing the summary report with investors through focus groups to confirm its usefulness before implementation.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file content discusses amendments to Rule 605 reports regarding the inclusion of orders with stop prices. The Commission adopted a definition of \"covered order\" to include orders with stop prices within the scope of Rule 605. The definition of \"executable\" for orders with stop prices was modified to align with when the stop price is triggered during regular trading hours. The Commission also added new categories for executable stop orders, such as market orders, marketable limit orders, and non-marketable limit orders.\n\nVarious commenters provided feedback on the treatment of stop orders, with some suggesting separate reporting categories for different types of stop orders. The Commission conducted a supplemental analysis of stop orders triggered in March 2023, showing that the majority were market orders when triggered. The Commission adopted definitions for \"executable stop marketable limit order\" and \"executable stop non-marketable limit order\" to categorize limit orders with stop prices based on their characteristics once triggered.\n\nThe Commission modified the execution quality statistics for marketable stop order types to align with market and marketable limit orders once triggered. Non-marketable stop orders will have different statistics calculated for them. The Commission did not adopt a recommendation to add a separate column for stop orders in the detailed report but instead created new order type categories for executable stop orders based on their characteristics once triggered.\n\nOverall, the Commission's amendments aim to provide more clarity and consistency in reporting and analyzing stop orders within the regulatory framework. The changes will help market participants compare statistics across firms and ensure accurate representation of different types of stop orders in Rule 605 reports.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the importance of Rule 605 reports in providing standardized execution quality information for market participants, particularly broker-dealers and investors. When a customer places an order with a broker-dealer, the broker-dealer acts as an agent and routes the order for execution to various market centers. Information assymetries exist between broker-dealers and market centers, leading to conflicts of interest. Standardized execution quality information from Rule 605 reports is crucial for investors to assess the quality of execution received from broker-dealers. The reports have been used by academics, analysts, and the financial press to study execution quality. \n\nIndividual investors have limited access to alternative sources of execution quality information, making Rule 605 reports valuable for them. However, the reports are machine-readable, which may limit accessibility for investors without necessary software or programming skills. Institutional investors, on the other hand, have access to alternative sources of execution quality information, such as transaction cost analysis. Rule 605 reports contain information about execution quality of held orders, which may not be relevant for institutional investors who mostly use not held orders. \n\nInvestment advisers and broker-dealers use Rule 605 reports as part of their internal review of execution quality to fulfill their best execution obligations. The disclosure requirements under preexisting Rule 605 have provided insight into execution quality at different market centers, but limitations exist, such as broker-dealers not being required to report under the rule. Overall, Rule 605 reports play a crucial role in providing transparency and facilitating the assessment of execution quality in the financial markets.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the potential impact of removing the de minimis provision for internet investment advisers, which allows them to have 15 or fewer non-internet clients. One alternative considered is reducing the maximum number of non-internet clients to five, which could strengthen the link between the Internet Adviser Exemption and internet advisory business. However, if an internet investment adviser advises non-internet clients, they should not be exempt from registration rules and should be regulated by a state or the Commission. This alternative may result in more erroneous registrations and withdrawals. Another alternative considered is defining a maximum number of non-internet clients as a percentage of the adviser's total clients, but this may not be fair or efficient in allocating regulatory responsibilities. The Commission also considered alternative definitions of \"interactive website\" by adding a different minimum number of clients or using terms like \"functioning\" or \"working\" instead of \"operational.\" These alternatives may have implications for advisers with small clientele or those in the early stages of their business.",

        "Summary": "The proposed amendments to the Internet Adviser Exemption aim to modernize the exemption and address industry developments since 2002. The changes include specifying that the exemption is available to advisers who provide advice exclusively through an operational interactive website, updating the definition of \"interactive website\" to include digital investment advisory services and mobile applications, and eliminating the de minimis exception for non-internet clients. These amendments are intended to align regulatory authority between the Commission and states, improve investor protection, and prevent misuse of the exemption.\n\nBy expanding the definition of \"interactive website\" to include digital investment advisory services, advisers using mobile applications and algorithms can benefit from the exemption, reducing the burden of multiple state registrations. The amendments also aim to prevent misleading clients by requiring advisers to represent their eligibility on Form ADV and removing the de minimis exception for non-internet clients. These changes are expected to streamline the registration process, improve examination efficiency, and clarify eligibility requirements for advisers relying on the Internet Adviser Exemption.",

        "Summary": "The proposed amendments aim to enhance investor protection by efficiently allocating regulatory resources to advisers with national presence and allowing smaller advisers with local presence to be regulated by states. The amendments introduce the concept of an \"operational interactive website\" for internet investment advisers, requiring them to provide digital investment advisory services to multiple clients continuously. The amendments also address technological issues, such as temporary outages, and permit the use of mobile applications for providing investment advice. Advisers must represent the presence of an operational interactive website on Form ADV. The proposed changes seek feedback on various aspects, including the definition of an operational interactive website, the handling of temporary outages, the provision of investment advice exclusively through the website, the feasibility of developing the website within 120 days, and the use of mobile applications for advisory services. The amendments aim to align the rule with technological advancements and ensure effective regulation of internet investment advisers.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the amendments to the internet adviser rule, specifically focusing on small entities subject to these amendments. The Commission estimates that approximately 266 investment advisers would be affected by the amended rule and proposed amendments to Form ADV. Out of the 489 SEC-registered advisers considered small entities, 190 would be impacted by the proposed amendments to rule 203A-2(e). \n\nThe proposed amendments to rule 203A-2(e) would impose reporting and compliance requirements on investment advisers relying on the exemption for registration with the Commission, including small entities. All internet investment advisers, estimated to be 266 advisers, would need to comply with the proposed rule's recordkeeping requirements. The annual burden for small advisers associated with the proposed amendments is estimated to be approximately 4 hours per adviser, totaling 760 hours in aggregate, with an expected annual cost of $323,000.\n\nAdditionally, proposed amendments to Form ADV would require investment advisers relying on the rule to register and remain registered with the Commission to make specific representations regarding providing investment advice exclusively through an operational interactive website. These requirements aim to enhance reporting and compliance for advisers, including small entities.",

        "Summary": "The amended rule in the pdf file focuses on amending the definitions used in the Internet Adviser Exemption, which allows internet investment advisers to register with the Commission. This exemption determines which advisers the Commission regulates and which fall under state regulation. The entities affected by the proposed amendments include advisers relying on the Internet Adviser Exemption, their clients, affiliated parties, and users of Form ADV data.\n\nThe regulatory baseline established by the NSMIA divides regulatory responsibility for advisers between the Commission and the states based on the size and presence of the advisers. Currently, advisers advising a registered investment company or managing assets above $100 million can register with the Commission, while others may be subject to state regulation. State laws vary, with exemptions for advisers with a low number of clients in a state.\n\nThe Internet Adviser Exemption allows advisers conducting business predominantly over the internet to register with the Commission. As of December 2022, a small percentage of registered investment advisers exclusively relied on this exemption. Registered internet investment advisers had an average of 5,506 clients, with some reporting no clients and others reporting over 500,000 clients. This exemption aims to alleviate the burden of registering with multiple states for advisers conducting business online.",

It estimates that approximately 266 investment advisers would be subject to the amended rule and proposed amendments to Form ADV. Out of the 489 SEC-registered advisers considered small entities, 190 would be affected by the proposed amendments to rule 203A-2(e) and corresponding changes to Form ADV.\n\nThe proposed amendments to rule 203A-2(e) would impose reporting and compliance requirements on investment advisers relying on the exemption for registration with the Commission, including small entities. All internet investment advisers, estimated to be 266 advisers, would need to comply with the requirement to maintain records as per the amended rule. The compliance, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements are summarized in the document, with detailed discussions in various sections. The professional skills required to meet these specific burdens are also outlined in the document.",

        "Summary": "The document discusses the implications of the minimum number of non-internet clients for advisers in terms of their registration requirements with the Commission and states. It highlights the potential unfairness and inefficiency in the allocation of adviser regulation responsibilities between the Commission and states based on the number of clients. The Commission also considers alternative definitions of \"interactive website\" to potentially limit registration to advisers with a national presence and prevent abuse of exemptions. However, increasing the minimum number of clients may disadvantage advisers with a small clientele or those in the early stages of their business. The document suggests using terms like \"functioning\" or \"working\" instead of \"operational\" in the definition of an interactive website to simplify the rule text, although this may lead to inconsistent interpretations among advisers.",

        "Summary": "The proposed changes to Form ADV for internet advisers relying on rule 203A-2e would require a separate text description of eligibility criteria, potentially preventing erroneous registrations. The exemption currently does not require a minimum number of clients, but the proposed amendment suggests that ongoing services to more than one client align better with the exemption's original purpose. The amendments may incur costs for advisers, such as developing an operational website or withdrawing Commission registration, potentially leading to state registrations. Advisers exclusively relying on the Internet Adviser Exemption with non-internet clients may need to register with states if client numbers exceed five. The amendments aim to focus on advisers advising solely through the internet, potentially requiring changes in communication or service delivery. The proposed changes may increase time and effort for advisers filing Form ADV but are expected to have minimal costs. The reduction in exemption-eligible advisers by 40% may not be a goal but reflects the narrow scope of the exemption. The proposal is not expected to significantly impact efficiency, competition, or capital formation, with potential positive effects on modernizing rules for technology use in the investment advisory industry. However, certain amendments, like removing the de minimis exception, could affect adviser-client interactions by limiting the scope of the exemption for providing advice beyond digital services.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the Internet Adviser Exemption created by the Commission in 2002, allowing investment advisers to register if they provide advice exclusively through an interactive website. As of December 2022, 266 advisers relied on this exemption, with the majority being small entities. These advisers had varying numbers of clients, with a skewed distribution towards fewer clients. The largest categories of clients were non-high net worth individuals, pension plans, and high net worth individuals. The data also indicated that most clients using internet advisers are non-high net worth individuals. The file also mentioned the potential eligibility of advisers for the multi-state exemption if they have clients in 15 or more states. The use of the Internet Adviser Exemption has increased over the years, with 266 advisers using it in 2022 compared to 15 in 2003. The reasons for choosing this exemption include potential reputational advantages, appeal to clients, and avoidance of individual state registration requirements. The file invites public comment on various aspects related to internet investment advisers and their compliance burdens.",

        "Summary": "The pdf file discusses the proposed elimination of the de minimis exception in the Internet Adviser Exemption, which allows internet investment advisers to provide advice to fewer than 15 non-internet clients. The rationale behind this proposal is that technological advancements and regulatory changes have made the exception less necessary than when it was originally adopted. The document seeks feedback on whether the de minimis exception should be eliminated, if existing advisers should continue to rely on it, and how advice provided outside an interactive website differs from that provided through the website. Additionally, it explores alternative approaches to the de minimis exception, such as setting a proportion of non-internet clients based on the number of internet clients. The file also raises questions about reporting requirements on Form ADV, potential changes to the exemption to accommodate different types of advisers, and adjustments to recordkeeping requirements. Ultimately, it prompts consideration of retaining or removing the Internet Adviser Exemption in light of other registration options available to internet investment advisers.",

        "Summary": "The document discusses proposed amendments to rule 203A-2(e) under the Advisers Act, which would impact small advisers registered with the Commission. Approximately 38.9% of all registered small advisers would be subject to these amendments, resulting in an estimated annual burden of 4 hours per adviser. This would lead to a monetized aggregate cost of $323,000 for small advisers. Additionally, proposed amendments to Form ADV would impose reporting and compliance requirements on investment advisers, including small entities, relying on the rule for registration. The document also mentions the absence of duplicative, overlapping, or conflicting federal rules related to the proposed amendments. Furthermore, the document highlights the consideration of significant alternatives to minimize adverse impacts on small entities, such as differing compliance requirements, simplification of reporting requirements, and exemptions for small entities.",
